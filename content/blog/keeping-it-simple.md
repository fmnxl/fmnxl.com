People who shun social media, hate big cooperations and commerialization of society. I think I'm one of them. But I wasn't one.

I was a Machester United fan (i.e. mainstream), I liked living in a massive metropolis, I wore a suit to be an *entrepreneur*.

As a developer, I was the guy who followed the latest fad.

I React-ified my client's whole Django site to purely client-side React, and when I started my startup company, I built it on MongoDB and "microservices" (because they've got to be scalable!).

Over the next few years, I ran out of money, I gave up on the glitzy life. I moved to Vietnam. And on the technical side of things, I migrated parts of that client's project back to the server. I learnt the value of a normalized database, and I understood the tradeoffs of microservices ([CAP theorem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CAP_theorem)).

I now use [Linux](https://nixos.org/), I write small server-rendered sites as monoliths, and [send plaintext transactional emails](https://useplaintext.email/).

Have I just given up? Just like the older developers I loathed.

Am I starting to shun progress in exchange for the comfort of stability?

But those simple things go much further than I thought. The humble command line. A 4G Nokia phone.

Where can I draw the line between true value and gimmickry.
