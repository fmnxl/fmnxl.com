I have an opinion. I don't like floating headers and footers.

Even on my 15-inch MBP, I still find it frustrating. It's worse on my 13-inch laptop and on smartphones.

Example of an obsctructed viewport:

I don't need an ever-present bar(s) showing me links I rarely use.

Another feature of some floating headers/footers that exacerbates the problem is those that expand when you scroll up. I guess the assumption is that scrolling up indicates that the user is finished with the content, but personally I often scroll back up to refer to a previous piece of information. Coupled with the expanding mobile headers & footers, the content is drowned out.

## Maximise content viewport availability

The "global" viewport is already taken by a number of permanent fixtures:
- operating system taskbar
- browser address bar, tabs bar, bookmarks bar, footer bar (on mobile)

## Alternatives

### Let them scroll to the header/footer

I think users are capable of scrolling to the top of the page either by tapping the top of the screen on mobile, or on desktop by holding **Page Up/Down** or simply scrolling.


### Floating buttons

### Scroll to top
