## About

Primarily I design user interfaces and build web applications (mostly with Javascript and Python). I like functional programming. I especially like using [Nix](https://nixos.org/).

Outside tech, I'm a linguistics hobbyist. I enjoy learning languages (id, en, zh, de, ru, es, vn).

Currently working remotely from the mountains near Bandung, Indonesia (GMT+7). Previously worked in London (2016-2020) and Nottingham (2012-2016).

## Work Contact
