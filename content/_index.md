## About

Full Stack dev at KaiOS, bringing connectivity to the masses.

I specialise in UI development and UX design.
I like functional programming. I especially like using [Nix](https://nixos.org/).

Outside tech, I'm a linguistics hobbyist. I enjoy learning languages (id, en, zh, de, ru, es, vn).

Currently based in the mountains near Bandung, Indonesia (GMT+7). Previously London (2016-2020) and Nottingham (2012-2016).
